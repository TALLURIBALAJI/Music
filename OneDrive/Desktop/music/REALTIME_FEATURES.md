# Real-Time Emotion-Based Music Player - Features

## ✅ What's Working Now

### 1. **Real-Time Emotion Detection** ⚡
- **Detection Speed**: Every 5th video frame (improved from 10th)
- **Update Frequency**: Approximately 6-10 times per second
- **Video Overlay**: Shows current emotion in real-time on video feed
- **Thread-Safe**: Uses threading.Lock for safe emotion state updates

### 2. **Automatic Song Switching** 🎵
- **Instant Change**: Song changes IMMEDIATELY when emotion changes
- **Auto-Refresh**: Page refreshes every 1 second to check for emotion changes
- **Forced Reload**: When emotion changes, audio player is forced to reload with new song
- **Session Tracking**: Uses `audio_key` to ensure new audio loads

### 3. **Audio Playback System** 🔊
- **Dual Audio Approach**:
  1. **Visible Player**: Streamlit native audio player with controls
  2. **Hidden Auto-play**: HTML5 audio element with autoplay and loop
- **Volume Control**: Set to 70% for comfortable listening
- **Continuous Play**: Music loops until emotion changes

### 4. **Emotion-to-Song Mapping** 🎭
```
Happy    → musics/happy.mp3
Sad      → musics/sad.mp3
Angry    → musics/angry.mp3
Fear     → musics/fear.mp3
Surprise → musics/Surprise.mp3
Neutral  → musics/Neutral.mp3
Disgust  → musics/Disgusting.mp3
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Detection Flow:
1. **Video Frame** → Captured every 5th frame
2. **Face Detection** → FER library detects face and analyzes emotions
3. **Emotion Identified** → Highest confidence emotion selected
4. **State Update** → Global emotion_state updated (thread-safe)
5. **Song Change** → If emotion changed, trigger audio reload
6. **Display Update** → Video overlay and UI show current emotion

### Audio Flow:
1. **Emotion Changed?** → Check if current_emotion ≠ last_played_emotion
2. **Update Key** → Increment audio_key to force new player
3. **Force Rerun** → Trigger st.rerun() to reload audio immediately
4. **Load New Song** → Read MP3 file for new emotion
5. **Play Audio** → Both visible player + hidden autoplay element
6. **Loop** → Music continues until next emotion change

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Frame Processing**
- Resize to 320x240 before emotion detection
- Process only every 5th frame
- BGR to RGB conversion for FER library

### 2. **UI Updates**
- 1-second refresh interval (balanced speed vs performance)
- 0.05s sleep before rerun (prevents excessive CPU usage)
- Smart session state management

### 3. **Thread Safety**
- Threading.Lock protects emotion state
- Atomic updates prevent race conditions
- Safe read/write from different threads
